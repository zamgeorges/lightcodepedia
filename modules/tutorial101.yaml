      👩‍🎓 This tutorial is a _light_-code `module` that demonstrates basic **building blocks**, or just `blocks`:
      
      - [x] Formatted `text` with *item lists* like __this__ one. 

      - [x] Basic blocks such as `image`, `text`, and `videos`.

      - [x] Interactive `maps`, `proxies` including content form other modules, and more ...

      - [x] Data components: `forms`, `grids` or `charts`.

      - [x] `Objects` — encapsulating `data`, `state` and behavior — and customized `functions`.

      - [x] `Quizzes` to test your knowledge.

      👩‍🎓 A `text` block is a simple block that displays formatted text.:
      
      - [x] Formatted `text`, with **bold**, *italic*, and :red[colors]. 

      - [x] *item lists* like __this__ one.   
      - [x] Here's a bouquet — 🌷🌸🌹🌺🌻🌼
      - [x] Text blocks use hints / helps. Did you find this one?
      - [x] Actually, all blocks use hints / helps.

      Docs about dogs can 
      use **bold** and _italic_ text and 
      also be quite long and boring ...
      
          In the haze of a London fog,
          A riff emerges, cutting like a saw.
          Strumming strings and pounding drums,
          Led Zeppelin, their magic comes.
      
          Amid the mist, a black dog roams,
          Guiding the band to rock and roll thrones.
          Not just a pet, but a symbol, a sign,
          Of music that transcends all time.

          Amid the crowd, the thunder roars,  
          With every note, the spirit soars.  
          From stairways high to oceans deep,  
          Their legacy forever to keep.
